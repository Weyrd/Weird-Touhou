## Description

This is a personal project that aims to create a Touhou-style game using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game is inspired by the popular bullet hell shooters of the Touhou Project series, known for their intense gameplay and intricate bullet patterns.

## Features

- Beautifully designed levels with intricate bullet patterns
- Multiple playable characters with unique abilities
- Engaging boss battles with dynamic attack patterns
- Power-ups and collectibles to enhance gameplay
- High score tracking and leaderboard

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Weyrd/Weird-Touhou/Weird-Touhou.git
   ```

2. Install SFML library (version X.X.X) by following the instructions at [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/).

3. Build the game using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

   ```bash
   g++ -o game main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
   ```

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./game
